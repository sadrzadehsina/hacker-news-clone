# Hacke News Clone

I like (HackerNews)[https://news.ycombinator.com/] as a repository of all happening in tech world. But to be honest its interface is the bad part. So I tried to make it just like the way I like it. This is my attempt so be patient while I am rebuilding it.

## How it is different
I like (React)[https://reactjs.org/] and I build everything I see with. This is not an exception at all. But React is not the only tool I am using to re-create hacker news. here is the list.

* For the interface, as my first experience I am using (bumbag)[https://bumbag.style/]. I liked it as soon as I installed it. It is easy to use and covers all the essentials.
* To talk to the outside world (side-effects), I used (axios)[https://github.com/axios/axios]. Nothing to much about it since it is popular enough.
* (react-query)[https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query] is the interesting part I realy enjoyed. It just make it as easy as you wish for managing you queries. Before this, I, personaly had to take care of all implementation details of a simple pagination. react-query just make it so simple, so I can focus on my business logics rather than the repetitive implementations.
